## Client Generation

To take this to next level we can use the swagger codegen to generate lanaguage specific clients (example C#, TS, Java etc.). A few things that to note that are:

1. You don't have to use the standard templates that come with swagger CLI you can define your own templates (they are written using {{mustache}} syntax).
2. You don't have to generate the client at all but IMO it helps to bring uniformity and you as the owner of a service can enforce uniformity in terms of how people consume your services.
3. If you have strong opinions around how the autogenerated code looks, performs or styled - I would recommend to use your own templates. You can do a lot fancy stuff there, in past I have generated client that did fancy loadbalancing on the client side using multi DNS mappings with round-robin and circuit-breaker patterns.

I am not showing the client generation here in the interest of time.
